### Openreads is an Android app written in Kotlin for keeping tracks of your books.  
#### There are three lists provided so you won't get confused:  
- books you finished,  
- books you are currently reading,  
- books you want to read later.

#### The books can be added by:
- looking up in Open Library database,
- scanning book's barcode,
- adding book's details manually.

####  You can also see come cool statistics!
