### Openreads is a privacy oriented and open source cross-platform app written in Flutter available for Android and iOS for keeping track of your books.  
#### There are four lists provided so you won't get confused:  
- books you finished,  
- books you are currently reading,  
- books you want to read later,
- books you didn't finish.

You can use custom tags and filter through them.

#### A book can be added by:
- looking it up in the Open Library database,
- scanning its barcode,
- adding its details manually.

####  You can also view some cool statistics!

The app is written in the cross-platform framework Flutter. Android and iOS versions are available.
Be aware that releasing an app to the App Store requires paid Apple Developer account ($99 per year) so please consider donating.
